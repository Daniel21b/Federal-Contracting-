The final project will provide hands-on experience designing, implementing, and deploying interactive visualizations. In particular, your
project should address a concrete visualization problem and propose a novel, creative solution and its scope and ambition should reflect the
5-6 weeks you have to work on it.

Whatʼll you do
Your task is to create a software artifact that explains a complex subject to the reader. The topic can range from a societal or political
issue to a scientific phenomenon, computer science algorithm, mathematical concept, or sociological theory. Focus on creating one or more
interactive diagrams interlinked with explanatory text or annotations. We urge you to focus on a highly visual and/or interactive experience,
as opposed to expecting a viewer to read large amounts of article text.

Examples highlighted in class include Harry Stevensʼ simulitis visualizations (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-
simulator/) and Barry & Cardʼs visualizations of the Boston subway system (https://mbtaviz.github.io/). For more examples, visit the
explorabl.es site (https://explorabl.es/) or the Idyll gallery (https://idyll-lang.org/gallery). Many examples for lectures are also great
references (e.g., Interaction, Animation, Storytelling lectures). Please do not choose a simple sorting algorithm or a search algorithm. If you
are unsure about a topic, please come discuss with the course staff.

Required: Proposal
Remember to register your team on Canvas (Final Project) before you submit the proposal. Your proposal should include the following
information:

A cool project title.
Names of all team member and Canvas Group number.
A short (1 to 2 paragraph) description of a concrete visualization problem you plan to address.
Whatʼll you do

Select a dataset (or datasets) relevant to your topic. Explain why the dataset is large or complex enough to warrant a visualization
project.
If your final project will be building off your previous assignments, your proposal should include description to help us gauge how your
extensions will represent concerted effort from all team members for 5-6 weeks worth of work. While your final version doesnʼt have to be
an exact match of your project, we expect that you maintain a clear connection to your original proposal, demonstrating substantial progress
and refinement based on our feedback.

Required: Deliverables
Your final project visualizations must be published on GitHub pages. We are very flexible about the underlying implementation of your
projects. We encourage you to use an available visualization toolkit, including D3.js, Vega, Vega-Lite, and Observable Plot. You can use
desktop-based libraries, and in this case, you must publish a video. Keep your source code. Projects must include some new code written
by your group. You should not simply use existing software such as Excel, Tableau, Illustrator, etc. to create the visualizations for your final
project. If you are unsure, talk to course staff during office hours.

Note: Timely submission of milestones and demos is crucial for staying on track with the project timeline. Late deliverables will receive a
score of 0 to ensure fairness and maintain project progress. We encourage you to plan ahead and reach out early if you anticipate any
challenges in meeting deadlines.

Milestone (April 30, 2025)
Develop an initial prototype of your project and publish your work in your GitHub repo. If applicable, publish any web-based visualizations
using GitHub Pages. It is fine if your project is not yet in a “complete” state; however, by this point, you should have made substantive
progress, including working (if rough) prototypes of your main visualizations and interactions. Each of you should prepare a short talk-
through of your prototype:

(1-2 min) A short introduction to your dataset and goals of your project: what is it that your visualization is trying to help a reader with,
and why it is important?
(2-3 min) A demonstration of your final project so far.
(1-2 min) A discussion of some of the key design decisions youʼve made so far (e.g., did you do any exploratory data analysis, and did
it reveal something interesting? Why did you pick these particular visual encodings, or interaction and animation techniques? What
alternative ideas did you explore or are you considering? etc.)
(1-2 min) A brief list of questions that you would like your peers in the class to comment on as part of their critique
However, if you are worried that code crashes or bugs, we recommend recording a video of your project as the backup plan. During the
lab, each of you individually will be paired with other 2-3 groups to swap your prototypes and presentations. For each project you are
assigned, we would like you to spend some time interacting with the visualization itself. Use the following guidelines to give each other
feedback:

Visual Encodings. Are expressive and effective visual encodings applied? How well do they reveal the most important features or
trends of the underlying data? Is critical data easily seen, or is it unnecessarily “hidden” and only revealed in response to interaction?
Is the target audience likely to understand the visualization?
Interaction & Animation Techniques. Do the supported interaction and animation techniques enable more effective discovery of
interesting trends, patterns, or outliers? Do they engage the viewer in a process of meaningful exploration or learning? Are they well-
implemented, without notable performance issues or usability problems?
Design Quality. Assess the overall design quality in terms of organization and presentation. Are elements appropriately titled or
labeled? Is there appropriate spacing, layout, legible type, and other forms of design styling? Is it clear where to begin
viewing/interacting with the design? Is the overall display confusing or cluttered? How successful is the prototype in meeting the
intended goals?
Demo day (May 19, 2025)
Final Project Showcase: We will host a final project demo session so that other students, instructors, and external visitors (if any) would be
able to interact with your work. Similar to the milestone review, your group should prepare a short talk-through:

(1-3 min) A short introduction to your dataset and goals of your project: what is it that your visualization is trying to help a reader with,
and why it is important?
(3-6 min) A demonstration of the key features of your final project.
During this demo session, instructors will walk around to review each groupʼs demo and presentation. We strongly encourage all team
members to attend and be prepared for a brief walk-through, allowing everyone to present their contributions and also explore other
teamsʼ work. If youʼre concerned about potential technical issues, consider recording a video as a backup plan. If a team member is unable
to attend the final demo session, please inform the instructors in advance with a clear team agreement and a valid reason.

Final submissions
Submission the URL(s) to your project on Canvas-ELMS by the demo session. Submit a URL to your live demo and a URL to the code repo
(they can be different repos). Note that GitHub Pages only supports vanilla HTML/CSS/JS; it does not support server-side logic. You will
likely need to use another hosting option for your application if you need server-side logic support. If your project is not web-based, provide
detailed build and running instructions as needed.

Your demo webpage should contain your final visualization or your video if you choose to build a desktop-based application.

In your code repo, you should include:

Project webpage: Include a project page with your project title, a brief description of your visualization, team members, running
instructions for the software (if applicable), and a breakdown of how the work was split among group members (Or in Canvas-ELMS if
you have privacy concerns.)
Code: an implementation of your system (source code and, if necessary, MacOS executable or build instructions).
Acknowledgement: Remember to acknowledge all appropriate sources not just in your write-up but also directly on your visualization
itself (including the source of your data, and any example visualization you drew inspiration from).
Teamwork
Collaboration is a crucial skill in both academia and industry, where complex problems are best tackled by teams with diverse perspectives
and expertise. Requiring students to work in teams encourages peer learning, improves problem-solving efficiency, and allows for division of
labor, ultimately leading to higher-quality projects. Additionally, teamwork fosters communication and project management skills that are
essential for professional success.

Teams should consist of 3 to 5 students, allowing for effective collaboration and a balanced workload. If you do not have a team, we
encourage you to post on Piazza or use lab sessions to find teammates. The course staff can also assist in matching students based on
shared interests, skills, and availability. If you need help forming a team, please reach out early.

To ensure fairness, the expected scope and complexity of your final project should be roughly proportional to the size of the team. Working
solo may limit opportunities for collaboration, peer learning, and exposure to diverse perspectives—key skills that this project is designed to
develop. To encourage teamwork, a 10 % penalty (-30 pts) will be applied to solo projects. A team of one or two will be evaluated in
comparison to teams of three, with the expectation that their performance and output will be reasonably comparable to larger teams.

While teams should ideally remain consistent throughout the project, students may switch between groups for different project stages if
needed. However, each student is responsible for ensuring a meaningful contribution at every stage, and the overall expectations for project
scope will still be proportional to the team size at each phase. If you anticipate needing to switch teams, please consult with the instructors.

Grading rubrics
The whole final project will count for 30 % of your final grade in the course. We will grade out of a total of 300 points. We will consider the
novelty of the idea, how it addresses the problem at hand, the methodology you employ in doing the research, and your proficiency in
implementing the idea. We will particularly focus on the usefulness of your results, as well as your choice of visualization and interaction
design decisions.
